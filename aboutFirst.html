      <br /><strong><u>What is FIRST?</u></strong> <br /><br />FIRST
      (<strong>F</strong>or Inspiration and Recognition of Science and
      Technology) is a global program that aims to encourage students to be more
      involved in the STEM fields. Not only do students in the FIRST program
      learn how to learn and program robots, they also learn lifetime skills
      such as Gracious Professionalism and communication skills. FIRST is also
      the worldâ€™s leading youth-serving nonprofit advancing STEM education. In
      total, FIRST has four different programs for different age groups,
      including FIRST Lego League, FIRST Technology Challenge and FIRST Robotics
      Competition. <br />To learn more about FIRST, visit

        ><u>What is FIRST Tech Challenge?</u></strong
      >
      <br /><br />FIRST Tech Challenge is one of three programs in FIRST. Using
      Java-based programming, students in grades 7-12 are challenged to design,
      build, program, and operate robots in a head-to-head challenge in an
      alliance format. Additionally, teams are encouraged to do community
      outreach to earn awards. <br />To learn more about FIRST Tech Challenge,
