      I focus on the hardware aspect of designing and building robots because I love coming up with my own ideas and physically recreating them.
      I am also responsible for driving the team robot at competitions, because being able to control and operate your final product is satisfactory and entertaining.

      I am the software lead and one of the team captains (I also used to be a
      driver and drive coach but doubt I'm doing that this year). I enjoy
      researching and learning about different ways to program robots, and I
      like to program and watch my code work successfully. It's also nice to
      lead meetings and teach the new members how to program.

      I am in 12th grade and have been doing FIRST Tech Challenge with this
      team for 7 years.
      <br /><br />
      My main role on this team is working on CAD modeling and creating
      custom-designed parts. I like being able to come up with my own designs
      to find the most efficient way to connect parts/solve the problem. I
      also organize outreach events and connect with professionals and my
      favorite part are the conversations I get to have with interested
      onlookers, hoping to learn more about our robot/the FIRST program.
