    Our team is composed of 10-students who participate in FIRST Tech
    Challenge. We are based in Bellevue, Washington, and our ages range from
    grade 8 all the way to grade 12, and we are from several school districts,
    including Lake Washington, Bellevue, and Issaquah School Districts. <br />

      This year, I'll be the hardware lead and engineering notebook lead. Both
      those roles are really exciting to me because I can practice leadership
      skills and I will be able to work with all parts of the physical robot.

      <!-- <strong><u>Role:</u></strong> -->
      <br />
      I love coding, especially programming robots, and watching them succeed.
      Learning from experienced team members about the robot's intricacies has been
      both enjoyable and educational. I've made great friends on the team and
      can't wait to collaborate with them throughout the year.

      I am in 9th grade and this is my second year doing FIRST Tech Challenge
      with this team.
      <br /><br />
      My main role on the team is outreach, but I also help out with hardware.
      For outreach, I always look foward to meeting people. For hardware, I
      enjoy the trial and error process.

      I am part of the 4 members that work on the software part of this team.
      The things I like about my role are how I get to learn about the code
      that actually makes the robot do tasks, and being able to work with the
      other team members.

      I am the software lead and one of the team captains (I also used to be a
      driver and drive coach but doubt I'm doing that this year). I enjoy
      researching and learning about different ways to program robots, and I
      like to program and watch my code work successfully. It's also nice to
      lead meetings and teach the new members how to program.

      I am in 12th grade and have been doing FIRST Tech Challenge with this
      team for 7 years.
      <br /><br />
      My main role on this team is working on CAD modeling and creating
      custom-designed parts. I like being able to come up with my own designs
      to find the most efficient way to connect parts/solve the problem. I
      also organize outreach events and connect with professionals and my
      favorite part are the conversations I get to have with interested
      onlookers, hoping to learn more about our robot/the FIRST program.
