      Challenge. We are based in Bellevue, Washington, and our ages range from
      grade 8 all the way to grade 12, and we are from several school districts,
      including Lake Washington, Bellevue, and Issaquah School Districts. <br />

        This year, I'll be the hardware lead and engineering notebook lead. Both
        those roles are really exciting to me because I can practice leadership
        skills and I will be able to work with all parts of the physical robot.

        I love coding, especially programming robots, and watching them succeed.
        Software in FTC is my passion. Learning from experienced team members
        about the robot's intricacies is both enjoyable and educational. I've
        made great friends on the team and can't wait to collaborate with them
        throughout the year.

        I'm in 8th grade and this is my first year doing FIRST Tech Challenge
        with this team.
        <br /><br />
        My main role on the team is outreach, but I also help out with
        hardware. For outreach, I always look foward to meeting people. 
        For hardware, I enjoy the trial and error process.

        other team members.

      I am the software lead and one of the team captains (I also used to be a
      driver and drive coach but doubt I'm doing that this year). I enjoy
      researching and learning about different ways to program robots, and I
      like to program and watch my code work successfully. It's also nice to
      lead meetings and teach the new members how to program.

      I am in 12th grade and have been doing FIRST Tech Challenge with this
      team for 7 years.
      <br/><br/>
      My main role on this team is working on CAD modeling and creating
      custom-designed parts. I like being able to come up with my own designs to
      find the most efficient way to connect parts/solve the problem. I also
      organize outreach events and connect with professionals and my favorite
      part are the conversations I get to have with interested onlookers, hoping
      to learn more about our robot/the FIRST program.
