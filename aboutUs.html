      Our team is comprised of 10-students who participate in FIRST Tech
      Challenge. We are based in Bellevue, Washington, and our ages range from
      grade 8 all the way to grade 12, and we are from several school districts,
      including Lake Washington, Bellevue, and Issaquah School Districts. <br />

        This year, I'll be the hardware lead and engineering notebook lead. Both
        those roles are really exciting to me because I can practice leadership
        skills and I will be able to work with all parts of the physical robot.

        I love coding, especially programming robots, and watching them succeed.
        Software in FTC is my passion. Learning from experienced team members
        about the robot's intricacies is both enjoyable and educational. I've
        made great friends on the team and can't wait to collaborate with them
        throughout the year.

        I'm in 8th grade and this is my first year doing FIRST Tech Challenge
        with this team.
        <br />
        <!-- <strong><u>Role:</u></strong> -->
        <br />
        My main role on the team is outreach/business, but I also work on
        hardware occasionally. For outreach, I'm excited to meet lots of unique
        individuals at competitions and while doing various events in the
        community. For hardware, I enjoy how there are many different ways to
        approach different problems and coming up with solutions. There's a lot
        of trial and error be in the end the work pays off.

        I am part of the 4 members that work on the software part of this team.
        The things I like about my role are how I get to learn about the code
        that actually makes the robot do tasks, and being able to work with the
        other team members.

      I am in 12th grade and and have been doing FIRST Tech Challenge with this
      team for 6 years.
      <br /><br />
      <strong><u>Role:</u></strong>
      <br />
      I am the software lead and one of the team captains (I also used to be a
      driver and drive coach but doubt I'm doing that this year). I enjoy
      researching and learning about different ways to program robots, and I
      like to program and watch my code work successfully. It's also nice to
      lead meetings and teach the new members how to program.

      I am in 12th grade and and have been doing FIRST Tech Challenge with this
      team for 7 years.
      <br /><br />
      <strong><u>Role:</u></strong>
      <br />
      My main role on this team is working on CAD modeling and creating
      custom-designed parts. I like being able to come up with my own designs to
      find the most efficient way to connect parts/solve the problem. I also
      organize outreach events and connect with professionals and my favorite
      part are the conversations I get to have with interested onlookers, hoping
      to learn more about our robot/the FIRST program.
