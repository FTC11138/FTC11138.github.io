    grade 8 all the way to grade 12, and we are from several school districts,
    including Lake Washington, Bellevue, and Issaquah School Districts. <br />

      This year, I'll be the hardware lead and engineering notebook lead. Both
      those roles are really exciting to me because I can practice leadership
      skills and I will be able to work with all parts of the physical robot.

      My name is Daren, and I‚Äôm a 10th grader at Eastside Prep.
      I‚Äôve been with this team for 2 years, and my leading roles on the team are hardware and driver.
      I focus on the hardware aspect of designing and building robots because I love coming up with my own ideas and physically recreating them.
      I am also responsible for driving the team robot at competitions, because being able to control and operate your final product is satisfactory and entertaining.
      In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and playing dbd.
      A fun fact about me is that I am üßè.

      I'm Ryan, a sophomore at Tesla STEM High School, A.K.A. Nerd School.
      This is my second season with the team. Right now,
      I'm working on software and I'm looking foward to being on the drive team again this year.
      Outside of robotics, I like playing Valorant, coding, and eating.
      A fun fact about me is that I only like foods that are hard to cook.

      I am part of the 4 members that work on the software part of this team.

      other team members.

      In my free time, I enjoy playing DnD, Tsuki Odyssey on my phone during walks, and reading.
      A fun fact about me is that I am a wannabe book critic.

      I am the software lead and one of the team captains (I also used to be a
      driver and drive coach but doubt I'm doing that this year). I enjoy
      researching and learning about different ways to program robots, and I
      like to program and watch my code work successfully. It's also nice to
      lead meetings and teach the new members how to program.

      I am in 12th grade and have been doing FIRST Tech Challenge with this
      team for 7 years.
      <br /><br />
      My main role on this team is working on CAD modeling and creating
      custom-designed parts. I like being able to come up with my own designs
      to find the most efficient way to connect parts/solve the problem. I
      also organize outreach events and connect with professionals and my
      favorite part are the conversations I get to have with interested
      onlookers, hoping to learn more about our robot/the FIRST program.
