            <br><strong><u>What is FIRST?</u></strong>
            <br><br>FIRST (<strong>F</strong>or Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a global program that aims to encourage students to be more involved in the STEM fields. Not only do students in the FIRST program learn how to learn and program robots, they also learn lifetime skills such as Gracious Professionalism and communication skills. FIRST is also the worldâ€™s leading youth-serving nonprofit advancing STEM education. In total, FIRST has four different programs for different age groups, including FIRST Lego League, FIRST Technology Challenge and FIRST Robotics Competition.

            <br><br>FIRST Tech Challenge is one of three programs in FIRST. Using Java-based programming, students in grades 7-12 are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots in a head-to-head challenge in an alliance format. Additionally, teams are encouraged to do community outreach to earn awards.
