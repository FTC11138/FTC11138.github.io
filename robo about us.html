                <br>
                This year, I'll be the hardware lead and engineering notebook lead. Both those roles are really exciting to me because I can practice leadership skills and I will be able to work with all parts of the physical robot.

                I love coding, especially programming robots, and watching them succeed. Learning from experienced team members about the robot's intricacies is both enjoyable and educational. I've made great friends on the team and can't wait to collaborate with them.

                My main role on the team is outreach, but I also help out with hardware. For outreach, I always look forward to meeting new people. For hardware, I enjoy the process of trial and error.

            <br><br>
            I am in 12th grade and and have been doing FIRST Tech Challenge with this team for 6 years.
            <br><br>
            <strong><u>Role:</u></strong>
            <br>
            I am the software lead and one of the team captains (I also used to be a driver and drive coach but doubt I'm doing that this year). I enjoy researching and learning about different ways to program robots, and I like to program and watch my code work successfully. It's also nice to lead meetings and teach the new members how to program.

            I am in 12th grade and and have been doing FIRST Tech Challenge with this team for 7 years.
            <br><br>
            <strong><u>Role:</u></strong>
            <br>
            My main role on this team is working on CAD modeling and creating custom-designed parts. I like being able to come up with my own designs to find the most efficient way to connect parts/solve the problem. I also organize outreach events and connect with professionals and my favorite part are the conversations I get to have with interested onlookers, hoping to learn more about our robot/the FIRST program.
