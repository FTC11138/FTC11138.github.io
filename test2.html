            About Us
        </h3>
        <br> <p style = "text-align:center">Our team is comprised of 10-students who participate in FIRST Tech Challenge. We are based in Bellevue, Washington, and our ages range from grade 8 all the way to grade 12, and we are from several school districts, including Lake Washington, Bellevue, and Issaquah School Districts. <br> <br> Below are introductions of our team members:</p> <br>
        <!-- <div style="display: flex;">

                    <br> <br>
                    I am in 12th grade and have been doing First Tech Challenge with this team for 6 years.
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong><u>Role:</u></strong>
                    <br>
                    I am the software lead and one of the team captains (I also used to be a driver and drive coach but doubt I'm doing that this year). I enjoy researching and learning about different ways to program robots, and I like to program and watch my code work successfully. It's also nice to lead meetings and teach the new members how to program.
                </p>

        <br> <p style="background-color: gray"> <strong>Nathan Zhang</strong> <br> <br> I am in 12th grade and and have been doing First Tech Challenge with this team for 7 years. <br> <br> <strong><u>Role:</u></strong> <br> My main role on this team is working on CAD modeling and creating custom-designed parts. I like being able to come up with my own designs to find the most efficient way to connect parts/solve the problem. I also organize outreach events and connect with professionals and my favorite part are the conversations I get to have with interested onlookers, hoping to learn more about our robot/the FIRST program. </p>

        <br> <p style="background-color: gray"> <strong>Shimon Keselman</strong> <br> <br> I am in 10th grade and have been doing First Tech Challenge with this team for 2 years. <br> <br> <strong><u>Role:</u></strong> <br> This year, I'll be the hardware lead and engineering notebook lead. Both those roles are really exciting to me because I can practice leadership skills and I will be able to work with all parts of the physical robot. </p>

        <br> <p style="background-color: gray"> <strong>Daren Lang</strong> <br> <br> I am in 9th grade and this is my first year doing First Tech Challenge with this team. <br> <br> <strong><u>Role:</u></strong> <br> Design brainstorming and HARDWARE. Itâ€™s fun. </p>
        <br> <p style="background-color: gray"> <strong>Ryan Chhabra</strong> <br> <br> I am in 9th grade and this is my first year doing First Tech Challenge with this team. <br> <br> <strong><u>Role:</u></strong> <br> I enjoy coding very much, especially programming robots and seeing them work successfully. I am therefore inclined towards software in FTC. I also have a lot of fun learning from my seniors about various intricacies in the robot. I have started making some good friends in the team and am looking forward to working with them for the rest of the year. </p>
        <br> <p style="background-color: gray"> <strong>Abigail Li</strong> <br> <br> I'm in 8th grade and this is my first year doing FIRST Tech Challenge with this team. <br> <br> <strong><u>Role:</u></strong> <br> My main role on the team is outreach/business, but I also work on hardware occasionally. For outreach, I'm excited to meet lots of unique individuals at competitions and while doing various events in the community. For hardware, I enjoy how there are many different ways to approach different problems and coming up with solutions. There's a lot of trial and error be in the end the work pays off. </p>
        <br> <p style="background-color: gray"> <strong>Sophia Shen</strong> <br> <br> I am in 8th grade and this is my first year doing FIRST Tech Challenge with this team. <br> <br> <strong><u>Role:</u></strong> <br> I am part of the 4 members that work on the software part of this team. The things I like about my role are how I get to learn about the code that actually makes the robot do tasks, and being able to work with the other team members. </p>
        <br> <p style="background-color: gray"> <strong>Robert Zhou</strong> <br> <br> I am in 8th grade and have been doing First Tech Challenge with this team for 1 year. <br> <br> <strong><u>Role:</u></strong> <br> I can do both hardware, software, and outreach, so i'm very versatile. </p>
